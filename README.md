# SCORE_KEEPER-_APP
## README: Score Keeper Mini-Project with React

### Overview
This README provides an overview of a mini-project focused on creating a score keeper application using React. It covers essential concepts related to JSX events, handling events, working with the virtual DOM, forms in JSX, iterating over arrays, creating and accessing refs, and understanding SyntheticEvent in React.

### Event Handling in JSX
1. React events use camelCase naming convention, e.g., `onClick` instead of `onclick`.
2. Event handlers are assigned as functions, e.g., `onClick={handleClick}`.

<button onClick={activateLasers}>Activate Lasers</button>


3. To prevent default behavior in React, use `e.preventDefault()` in the event handler.


<form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>


### Virtual DOM
1. The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is a memory-based representation of the UI in React.
2. It allows for efficient updates to the real DOM through a process called reconciliation.
3. JSX simplifies the creation of React elements, making code more readable.


const title = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;

### Event Handling in Components
1. In class components, event handlers are often defined as methods within the component.


class Toggle extends React.Component {
  handleClick() {
    // Handle the click event
  }
  
  render() {
    return (
      <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Toggle</button>
    );
  }
}


2. Ensure proper binding when using `this` in event handlers.

### Forms in JSX
1. Use controlled components to manage form data in React.

function Form() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState('');

  function handleChange(event) {
    setValue(event.target.value);
  }

  function handleSubmit(event) {
    alert('A name was submitted: ' + value);
    event.preventDefault();
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input type="text" value={value} onChange={handleChange} />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
    </form>
  );


### Iterating Over Arrays in JSX
1. Utilize the `map()` method to transform elements in an array.


const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doubled = numbers.map((number) => number * 2);

2. Use curly braces `{}` to include dynamic content in JSX.

### Refs in React
1. Create and attach refs using `React.createRef()`.


const inputRef = React.createRef();


2. Access refs to manipulate DOM elements.


<input ref={inputRef} placeholder="Name" />


### SyntheticEvent
1. React provides a cross-browser wrapper for events called `SyntheticEvent`.
2. It offers consistent event handling across different browsers.

### Summary
This mini-project covers fundamental concepts in React, including event handling in JSX, working with the Virtual DOM, form handling, iterating over arrays, creating and accessing refs, and understanding SyntheticEvent.
